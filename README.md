# Developer Relations at MeiliSearch

We will slowly add all our processes in this repo. This is how we roll at MeiliSearch, open source to the core! You can also have an idea of what the developer relations team is working on by checking the [devrel issues](https://github.com/meilisearch/devrel/issues) (for devrel tasks only).

## Our Mission

We help developers be successful by nurturing a healthy and open-source community around MeiliSearch. This means listening to, inspiring, educating, and supporting our community however we can.

## The 3Cs

The three pillars of Developer Relations are **C**ommunity, **C**ontent, and **C**ode, also known as the 3Cs*. The main focus of our team is the community: just read our mission to understand that everything we do is for our community. To help us achieve our mission, we use two main activities: content and code. The former is any type of content on any useful medium; some examples are talks at conferences, documentation, or video tutorials. The latter, code, is part of the foundation of who we are: we are developers. It translates into code examples for the documentation, code demos for our conference presentations, technical support, or even being responsible for specific APIs or contributing to open source to give back to the community and be a good web citizen. All together, they form the foundation of developer relations.
