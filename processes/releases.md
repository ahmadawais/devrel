# New MeiliSearch releases - what to do

Those are the steps we need to take every time we release a new version of MeiliSearch.

## Responsibilities

Right now, unless mentioned, the tasks for a new release on the developer relations side are divided in three categories or actions with each person accountable for them:
- Documentation & guides: [@react-learner](https://github.com/react-learner)
- Blog posts: [@CaroFG](https://github.com/CaroFG)
- Social media: [@fharper](https://github.com/fharper)

## After the last release

1. Create a PR on a branch called prepare-meilisearch-[YYYY]-[WW] (i.e.: prepare-meilisearch-2020-03 for the third week of the year 2020) in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation).
1. Ensure that all new PRs related to the next release are done on the mentioned above.
1. The documentation must contain at minimum the references of the new feature(s), if any.
1. The decision should be made if we need to create a [guide](https://docs.meilisearch.com/guides/) for the new feature(s), if any.

## Pre-release week

1. If the release has substantial new features, we should draft a [blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/) post about the new release.
1. The prepare-meilisearch-[YYYY]-[WW] should be reviewed and ready to merge to the [master branch](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/tree/master).

## Release day

1. The prepare-meilisearch-[YYYY]-[WW] branch should be merged with the [master brand](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/tree/master), and updated version of the documentation published [in production](https://docs.meilisearch.com/).
1. Once in production, we should publish the blog post, if any.

_For the next steps, we will share the blog post: if none, we will share the [release notes](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/releases) from GitHub._

3. Share in the #general channel of our [Slack community](https://slack.meilisearch.com/);
1. Share on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/discussions);
1. Share on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meilisearch);

_If the release contains enough interesting new features, we should:_

6. share on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meilisearch);
1. share on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) (need to add the sub/subs);

_If the release is astonishing only, we should:_

8. share on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
